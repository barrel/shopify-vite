Volt, a Vite plugin for Shopify development is an ESM-only package. To use it with [Vite 5](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite5), we need
to add `"type": "module"` to the `package.json` of our projects OR change the extension of our Vite config file to `.mjs`/`.mts`.

### Major Changes

We have deprecated the `vite-plugin-shopify-modules` and `vite-plugin-shopify-theme-settings` packages from our NPM repository.
These packages are no longer necessary and do not provide any additional benefit, and their presence can cause additional complexity
and confusion.

> **Note**
> After removing "vite-plugin-shopify-modules" from your theme, you could manually configure the `@modules` alias in Vite to maintain
> compatibility with this alias in your code.
